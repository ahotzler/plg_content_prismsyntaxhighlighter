## Overview

If you want to use TinyMCE in Joomla! and its builtin "Insert/Edit code" feature, you need this plugin to have syntax highlighting on your site. SyntaxHighlighting is based on PRISM, but the necessary JScript and CSS files are not loaded after you close TinyMCE.
This Plugin adds the necessary JScript and CSS files to your site.

## Features

* Use of Joomla!-Updater
* possibilty to select various "Styles"
* possibilty to use the autoloader feature to support more languages, than offered by TinyMCE
* possibilty to use line-numbers (you have to add "line-numbers" to the css-class of the \<pre\>-Element)
* uses own and local CSS/JS storage, no loading of external ressources, syntaxhighlighting will not stop after removal of TinyMCE (some visual themes may load external fonts)
